      Programming has always intrigued me with its endless possibilities to
      create and innovate. I enjoy solving complex problems and building
      solutions that make an impact. 


      With expertise in Python, Java, C#, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and SQL, I
      am passionate about crafting efficient software and exploring the
      intersection of web development, data science, and machine learning.
