**Project Overview**
The Skin Cancer Classification Web App is a full-stack solution designed to assist in early detection and classification of skin cancer variants. The app integrates cutting-edge deep learning models with an intuitive user interface, making it a powerful tool for medical professionals and researchers.

**Key Features**

*   **Deep Learning Models:** Utilized ResNet50, AlexNet, and VGGNet for robust image classification.

*   **Web Interface:** Developed with Streamlit for a seamless and user-friendly experience.

*   **Image Preprocessing:** Included image scaling, normalization, and augmentation techniques to improve model performance.

*   **Real-time Predictions:** Upload an image and receive instant classification results.

*   **Interactive Visualizations:** Display model predictions, confidence scores, and input image overlays for better understanding.

**Tech Stack**

*   **Frontend:** Streamlit

*   **Backend:** Python, Pandas, NumPy

*   **Models:** ResNet50, AlexNet, VGGNet (pretrained on ImageNet)

*   **Libraries:** TensorFlow, Keras

**Highlights**

*   Achieved high accuracy in distinguishing between benign and malignant skin lesions.

*   Ensured scalability and portability with a lightweight design and efficient resource use.

*   Simplified deployment with an interactive interface, enabling wider accessibility.

**How It Works**

1.  Users upload an image of a skin lesion.

2.  The app preprocesses the image to ensure it meets model requirements.

3.  The selected deep learning model analyzes the image and classifies it as benign or malignant.

4.  Results are displayed alongside confidence scores and visualization overlays.

**Future Enhancements**

*   Expand the model to classify additional skin conditions.

*   Integrate with medical databases for a broader dataset.

*   Enhance the appâ€™s responsiveness for mobile devices.

This project demonstrates how technology and deep learning can contribute to healthcare innovation.
