**Project Overview**
This project involves the development of a city-building simulation prototype using Unity. The game incorporates dynamic area instantiation, AI-driven player interactions, and object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to create an engaging and scalable virtual environment.

**Key Contributions**

*   **Dynamic Instantiation:**

    *   Designed a modular city layout with dynamic instantiation of buildings, roads, and utilities.

    *   Enabled scalable city expansion with OOP concepts for efficient management of game assets.

*   **AI Integration:**

    *   Developed AI-driven non-playable characters (NPCs) with raycasting for player detection and interaction.

    *   Implemented distance-based decision-making for NPC behaviors.

*   **Gameplay Features:**

    *   Incorporated customizable building options and resource management.

    *   Enabled user-driven city development with intuitive controls and real-time updates.

**Technologies Used**

*   **Game Engine:** Unity

*   **Programming Language:** C#

*   **Features:** Raycasting, dynamic object instantiation, and OOP principles

**Highlights**

*   Prototyped a scalable city-building system with interactive gameplay mechanics.

*   Successfully combined AI logic and OOP to create an immersive player experience.

*   Optimized performance for smooth gameplay, even with large-scale city layouts.
