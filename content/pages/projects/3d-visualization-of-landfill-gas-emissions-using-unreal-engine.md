description: >-
  Created an advanced 3D visualization system for landfill gas emissions using
  Unreal Engine, processing LIDAR data into realistic surface models. Integrated
  CSV-based gas concentration data to simulate emission patterns with real-time
  atmospheric effects, providing an intuitive and interactive environmental
  monitoring tool.

**Project Overview**
This project leverages LIDAR point cloud data to create advanced 3D visualizations for modeling and monitoring landfill gas (LFG) emissions. Using a combination of Autodesk Recap, Global Mapper, and Unreal Engine, the project provides intuitive and interactive visual representations of environmental data.

**Key Contributions**

*   **LIDAR Data Processing:**

    *   Processed raw LIDAR point cloud data to remove outliers and generate high-quality surface meshes in Autodesk Recap.

    *   Enhanced the model by applying detailed textures created using Global Mapper.

*   **Gas Emission Modeling:**

    *   Designed a pipeline to import .csv data of gas concentrations and process it into a 3D model.

    *   Incorporated red and green color gradients to represent varying concentration levels intuitively.

*   **Advanced Visualization in Unreal Engine:**

    *   Imported textured surface models and concentration data into Unreal Engine.

    *   Applied the Niagara engineâ€™s particle system to simulate atmospheric effects for real-time interaction and improved visual fidelity.

**Technologies Used**

*   **Data Processing Tools:** Autodesk Recap, Global Mapper

*   **Visualization Engine:** Unreal Engine with Niagara Particle System

*   **Data Formats:** LIDAR (.las), CSV/XLS

**Highlights**

*   Developed highly detailed 3D models for real-world landfill monitoring applications.

*   Created visually engaging and interactive simulations for better decision-making and environmental assessment.

*   Achieved real-time atmospheric effects to enhance the realism of the visualizations.
