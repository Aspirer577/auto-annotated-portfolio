      **Overview**

      This publication introduces a virtual mouse system that leverages computer
      vision techniques for touch-free human-computer interaction. The system
      utilizes real-time hand gesture recognition to perform mouse operations
      such as click, drag, and scroll, offering an innovative and hygienic
      alternative to traditional input devices.


      **Key Highlights**


      *   **Technology Used:**

          *   Implemented using Python and OpenCV for real-time image processing.

          *   Utilized Haar cascades and contour detection for hand gesture recognition.

      *   **Features:**

          *   Supported functionalities like left-click, right-click, double-click, drag, and scroll using specific hand gestures.

          *   Designed for a touch-free experience, enhancing usability in public or shared environments.

      *   **Applications:**

          *   Ideal for scenarios requiring minimal physical contact, such as healthcare settings, public kiosks, and educational environments.

      **Published In**
